To analyze the data, I used Jupyter Notebook and the accompanying dataset to develop codes and plots to conduct analysis. The code is saved in the “Assignment_5_1.ipnyb” file.

Observations:

According to the data:
1.	Customers who frequently visit bars tend to have a higher acceptance rate for bar-related coupons. Specifically, drivers who visit bars more than three times a month show a significantly greater likelihood of accepting bar coupons compared to those who visit less frequently.
2.	There isn't a clear pattern in acceptance rates based solely on age being over 25, suggesting other factors play a more significant role.
3.	Passengers who are adults and work in fields other than farming, fishing, or forestry tend to have higher acceptance rates for bar coupons. This trend suggests that there may be a social component to bar visits, making these coupons more attractive to individuals who enjoy going out with friends or colleagues.
4.	Drivers who are not widowed and go to bars more than once a month, without kids as passengers, have a higher acceptance rate. This further supports the idea that bar coupons are more attractive to individuals in social situations or those without family constraints.

Who accepts bar coupons?
Based on these data drivers who are more likely to accept bar coupons are those who:
•	Frequently visit bars: They are already inclined towards bar visits, making the coupon an incentive to continue their existing behavior.
•	Go to bars for social reasons: The presence of adult passengers and occupations outside of specific fields (farming, fishing, forestry) suggests a social motivation for bar visits.
•	Are not constrained by family obligations: The higher acceptance rate among those not widowed and without kids as passengers indicates fewer family constraints on their decision-making.
